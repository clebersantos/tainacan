# Introduction
visualRDF aims to provide a nice graphical visualization of an RDF graph.

visualRDF is a one night-fork from visualSPARQL (see my profile for more projects).
It will probably stay in this status for a while.

visualRDF uses d3.js[1] for rendering and ARC2[2] for parsing RDF.

If you have any comments, bug reports, etc. Please create an issue on github.

# Demo

A demo is available at http://graves.cl/visualRDF
